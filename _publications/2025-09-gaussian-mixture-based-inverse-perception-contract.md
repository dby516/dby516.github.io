title: "Gaussian Mixture-based Inverse Perception Contract for Uncertainty Aware Safe Navigation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-09-gaussian-mixture-based-inverse-perception-contract
excerpt: 'This work models perception uncertainty for safe navigation by representing uncertainty as multiple Gaussians, the approach captures fine-grained structures that [baseline method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13515) overlook. This enables more effective motion planning while maintaining probabilistic safety guarantees.'
