title: "Tactile-based Online Active Shape Exploration and Reconstruction using Reinforcement Learning"
collection: projects
permalink: /project/2025-05-tactor
excerpt: 'This is a team project of Deep Learning for Robotic Manipulation course at Columbia. It learns an RL policy for active 3D shape exploration using tactile sensing, enabling robots to perceive objects that are visually occluded. The system is built and evaluated in IsaacSim/IsaacLab with diverse geometries, demonstrating effective online tactile-based reconstruction of unseen objects.'
