excerpt: 'This is a team project from the Deep Learning for Computer Vision course at Columbia. We improved a SOTA text-guided shape editing framework [ChangeIt3D](https://changeit3d.github.io/) by leveraging a region-attended editor that leverages shape correspondence to enable more precise, localized geometry modifications.'
