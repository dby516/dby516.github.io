I am a 2nd-year Master's student in Computer Science at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in China.  

My research interests lie broadly in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and their intersections with Robot Navigation, Manipulation and Computer Vision. I'm especially interested in enabling learning-based methods to benefit robot navigation and motion in open-world environments, as well as in quantifying and constraining the uncertainty introduced by learning methods to form a strong, effective, safe, and trustworthy autonomous system.
